# Walk through of data splits for sanity-checked experiment

- `data/all_texts.csv`: All raw texts combined from all authors.
- `data/train_split.csv`: 80% random stratified split for training (contains `text`, `label`, `filename`).
- `data/test_split.csv`: 20% random stratified split for testing (contains `text`, `label`, `filename`).

These splits are created to ensure no data leakage and will be used for all downstream feature extraction, training, and evaluation.
