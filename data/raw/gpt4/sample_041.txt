Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The pivot element itself is then in its correct position. This process is recursively applied to the sub-arrays until the whole array is sorted. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### 1. Choose a Pivot

First, select an element from the array as the pivot. The choice of pivot can affect the performance of the quicksort algorithm. Common methods include choosing the first element, the last element, the middle element, or a random element as the pivot. Some advanced strategies may choose the median of a small sample of elements from the array.

### 2. Partitioning

Rearrange the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it. After partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is done by:

- Starting from the first index, look for an element greater than the pivot.
- Starting from the end, look for an element less than the pivot.
- Swap these elements if the start index is less than the end index.
- Continue this process until the start index is greater than or equal to the end index.

### 3. Recurse on Sub-arrays

Apply the above steps recursively to the two sub-arrays formed by splitting the array around the pivot. The recursion is applied to the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot, which have not yet been sorted.

### 4. Base Case

The base case of the recursion is arrays with less than two elements, which don't need to be sorted.

### Example

Consider the array: `[3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]`

- **Pivot Selection:** Choose the last element as the pivot, so `pivot = 1`.
- **Partitioning:** After partitioning, the array might look like `[1, 1, 8, 10, 3, 2, 6]`, with all elements less than or equal to `1` on the left and all elements greater than `1` on the right. The exact outcome might vary based on the partition strategy.
- **Recurse:** Recursively
