Regularization in neural networks is a crucial technique used to prevent overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a neural network learns the training data too well, capturing noise and fluctuations that do not represent the underlying data distribution. This leads to poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization techniques modify the learning process to impose constraints on the model's complexity, encouraging it to learn more general patterns.

There are several regularization methods used in neural networks, each with its approach to mitigating overfitting:

### 1. L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)
L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This can lead not only to smaller coefficients but can also reduce some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. In neural networks, this would translate to a sparser model with some weights being zero.

### 2. L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)
L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This encourages the weights to be small but does not necessarily drive them to zero. L2 regularization is more common in neural networks and is often referred to as "weight decay" in this context.

### 3. Dropout
Dropout is a widely used regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 at each step, effectively "dropping out" random features. This prevents the network from becoming too reliant on any one node and encourages the network to learn robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons.

### 4. Early Stopping
Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping training when performance begins to degrade (indicating the model is beginning to overfit to the training data). This method is straightforward and effective, ensuring the model retains good generalization capabilities.

### 5. Batch Normalization
Although primarily used to help with convergence and training speed, batch normalization can also have a regularizing effect. By normalizing the input of each layer to have a mean of zero and a variance of one, it helps to reduce internal covariate shift, which can also help in mitigating overfitting.

### 6. Data Augmentation
Data augmentation involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the training data, typically through transformations that
