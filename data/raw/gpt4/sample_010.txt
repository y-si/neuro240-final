Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly effective for image recognition and processing tasks. They are inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex and are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview of how CNNs process images:

### 1. Input Layer

- The process begins with the input layer, where the image is fed into the CNN. Images are typically represented as a matrix of pixel values. For colored images, there are three color channels (Red, Green, Blue), so an image can be represented as a 3D array of pixel values.

### 2. Convolutional Layer

- The first step in processing is typically a convolutional layer. This layer applies several filters (also known as kernels) to the input image to create feature maps. These filters are small but extend through the full depth of the input volume (for RGB images, that means through all three color channels).
- Each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input image, computing the dot product between the entries of the filter and the input at any position. As a filter slides over the input image, a feature map is produced, which gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. The intuition behind this is that the network will learn filters that activate when they see specific types of features such as edges, colors, or textures.

### 3. Activation Function

- After the convolution operations, an activation function is typically applied to introduce non-linearity into the model. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a common activation function used in CNNs, which simply replaces all negative pixel values in the feature map with zero. The non-linearity is crucial for learning more complex patterns in the data.

### 4. Pooling (Subsampling or Down-sampling) Layer

- The next step is often a pooling layer, which reduces the dimensionality of each feature map while retaining the most important information. Max pooling, where the maximum element is selected in the region of the feature map covered by the filter, is a common method. This operation reduces the computational complexity for the upcoming layers and helps in making the detection of features invariant to scale and orientation changes.

### 5. Fully Connected Layer

- After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done by fully connected layers. At this stage
