Both stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used in computer science to organize and manage data, but they operate in significantly different ways based on their access patterns and use cases. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

1. **Access Pattern (LIFO vs FIFO):**

   - **Stack:** A stack follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access pattern. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of a stack of plates; you add (push) a new plate on top and remove (pop) the top plate when needed.
   
   - **Queue:** A queue operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) access pattern. The first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is similar to a line of people waiting for a service; the first person to line up is the first to get served and leave the queue.

2. **Primary Operations:**

   - **Stack:** The primary operations for a stack are `push` (to add an item to the top of the stack) and `pop` (to remove the top item from the stack). Often, there are auxiliary operations like `peek` (to view the top item without removing it) and `isEmpty` (to check if the stack is empty).
   
   - **Queue:** The basic operations for a queue are `enqueue` (to add an item to the end of the queue) and `dequeue` (to remove the item from the front of the queue). Similar auxiliary operations like `peek`/`front` (to view the item at the front of the queue without removing it) and `isEmpty` (to check if the queue is empty) are commonly used.

3. **Use Cases:**

   - **Stack:** Stacks are used in scenarios where you need to reverse things or access elements in a reverse manner. This includes function calls/returns in programming languages, undo mechanisms in applications, parsing expressions (e.g., in calculators), and for depth-first search in graph algorithms.
   
   - **Queue:** Queues are used when you need to manage tasks in an order they were received. This includes scheduling tasks (e.g., in operating systems or printers), handling asynchronous data (e.g., in web server request handling), and for breadth-first search in graph algorithms.

4. **Implementation:**

   Both stacks and queues can be implemented using
