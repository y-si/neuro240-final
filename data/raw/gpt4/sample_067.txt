RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks (originally Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks). It is a method of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard disks to protect data in the case of a drive failure and, in some configurations, to improve performance. RAID levels describe the balance each method strikes between performance, availability, and capacity. Here's a basic overview of RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5:

### RAID 0 (Striping)
- **Purpose**: To increase performance.
- **How it Works**: Data is split into blocks and each block is written to a separate disk drive. This means each disk drive in the array works on a different part of a request at the same time, significantly improving performance.
- **Capacity Use**: 100% of the total capacity of the drives in the array is usable.
- **Fault Tolerance**: None. If one drive fails, all data in the RAID 0 array is lost.
- **Use Case**: Situations where performance is critical and data redundancy is not required, such as in non-critical applications or as a scratch disk in video editing.

### RAID 1 (Mirroring)
- **Purpose**: To ensure data redundancy.
- **How it Works**: Data is copied identically from one disk to another, creating a "mirror." Every write operation is carried out on both disks.
- **Capacity Use**: 50% of the total capacity of the drives in the array is usable, as each piece of data is stored twice.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Very high. If one disk fails, the system can instantly switch to the other disk without losing data.
- **Use Case**: Situations where data integrity and redundancy are critical, with minimal downtime in the event of disk failure, such as in critical databases or systems.

### RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)
- **Purpose**: To provide a balance between performance, capacity, and redundancy.
- **How it Works**: Data and parity (a form of error checking) information are striped across three or more disks. If a single disk fails, the data can be reconstructed from the remaining disks using the parity information.
- **Capacity Use**: The equivalent of one disk's capacity in the array is used for parity, so with N disks, the capacity is equivalent to N-1 disks.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Can survive the failure of one disk without data
