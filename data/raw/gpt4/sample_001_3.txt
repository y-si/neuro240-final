Certainly! Imagine a neural network as a complex network that's somewhat like our human brain, designed to recognize patterns. Here’s a simplified way to understand how they work:

1. **Inspiration from the Brain**: Just like the human brain processes information using a large network of neurons, a neural network in the world of artificial intelligence does this through structures called artificial neurons. These neurons are digital replicas meant to mimic some functions of human neurons, enabling the machine to learn and make decisions.

2. **Layers of Neurons**: A typical neural network has layers of these artificial neurons:
   - **Input Layer**: This takes in the raw data. For example, if the goal is to recognize images of cats and dogs, this layer takes an image as an input.
   - **Hidden Layers**: These are in between the input and output. Typically, more layers and neurons mean the network can capture more complex features like edges, shapes, and textures in images. Networks with many different layers are called "deep neural networks," explaining the term "deep learning."
   - **Output Layer**: This layer gives us the final decision or prediction. It might tell us whether the image shows a cat or a dog.

3. **Learning Process**: Here’s the clever part - the network learns by adjusting itself based on mistakes:
   - It starts with guesses. It makes predictions based on its existing settings (commonly random in the beginning).
   - **Learning from mistakes**: Just as a student learns from mistakes and improves, the network adjusts through a process called training. Based on errors it made (difference between its prediction and correct answer), it fine-tunes the connections (known as weights) between neurons.
   - **Iterations**: This process happens repetitively; with every new piece of data or a new round of training, the model tries to minimize its mistakes and improve accuracy. 

4. **Feedback Loop**: This adjustment is directed by something called backpropagation, which mathematically calculates error and instructs the network on how to adjust its weights effectively. Continued training with repeated iterations, fine-tunes the neuronal settings to better perform the task (like better accuracy at differentiating cats from dogs after "seeing" thousands of pictures).

In essence, neural networks are a mathematical approximation created through stacked layers of neurons, skilled at taking in large sets of data, learning underlying patterns, and diving decisions to solve complex tasks ranging from distinguishing images to powering self-driving cars and aiding in medical diagnoses.
