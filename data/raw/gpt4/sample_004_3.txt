Activation functions are critical components in neural networks that serve several essential purposes:

1. **Non-linearity**: Primarily, activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network. Basic neural network operations involving weights and biases construct linear operations. However, most real-world data we want neural networks to make predictions on is non-linear. By applying a non-linear activation function, complex functions can be learned, effectively allowing the network to make sense of highly intricate or complicated data patterns which are necessary for tasks like image recognition and natural-language processing.

2. **Transformation of Signals**: Activation functions take the inputs, multiplied by the network's weights and summed with biases, and convert these values into outputs that form thresholds. This metamorphosed signal either passes or is transformed as contributions to the next layer. Without these transformations, a neural network would be merely a combination of linear regressions.

3. **Control Information Flow**: They also help control the flow of information through the network by modulating the output between layersâ€”acting like gates.

4. **Training Depth**: In deep learning particularly, activation functions also enable training on deep networks effectively. Non-linearities allow networks to converge faster and provide better solutions.

To understand some elastical examples:

- **Sigmoid Activation Function**: It throttles values to be in the range of 0 to 1, acting culumatively good for layers where outputs are mapped to probabilities which mark activation or necessary thresholds in neural data.
 
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Extremely popular for middle layers because it efficiently solves certain neural diminish woes by outputting zero when it receives negative input but stays viably linear with positive input. Its half-nonlinear city contributes to aplenty beneficial propagation environments.

- **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**: It shapes data into values from -1 to 1. It's like the sigmoid function but spreaded like reflected across `y = 0` which aids harder sogarization in some condensed data regimes.
 
- **Softmax**: Used often in the final-output layer for multi-class prediction as it normalizes an output distribution over the defined categories proficiently and hashes them into probabilities.
