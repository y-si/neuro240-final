A microservice architecture is an approach to developing software applications as a collection of small, independent services. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This is in contrast to a monolithic architecture, where an application is built as a single, large unit.

Key characteristics of microservices:
1. Independently deployable: Each microservice can be deployed and updated independently of others.
2. Loosely coupled: Microservices are designed to minimize dependencies between each other.
3. Focused on a single business capability: Each microservice is responsible for a specific function or capability.
4. Communicate via APIs: Microservices use lightweight protocols like HTTP/REST or messaging queues to interact.

Benefits of a microservice architecture:

1. Scalability: Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand, allowing for better resource utilization and performance.

2. Flexibility: Teams can choose the best technology stack for each microservice, enabling flexibility and innovation.

3. Resilience: If one microservice fails, it is less likely to bring down the entire application, as other services can continue to function.

4. Easier maintenance and updates: Small, focused services are easier to understand, maintain, and update compared to a large monolithic application.

5. Faster development and deployment: Teams can develop, test, and deploy microservices in parallel, speeding up the overall development process.

6. Reusability: Microservices can be reused across multiple applications, reducing development efforts.

However, microservices also introduce complexities such as increased operational overhead, the need for robust inter-service communication, and potential data consistency challenges. Architects should carefully evaluate the trade-offs before adopting a microservice architecture.
