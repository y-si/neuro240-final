Imagine you have a brain made up of tiny, interconnected units called neurons. Each neuron receives input signals, processes them, and then sends output signals to other neurons. This is similar to how a neural network works, but instead of biological neurons, we use artificial "neurons" (called nodes or units) in a computer program.

In a neural network, nodes are organized into layers:

1. Input layer: This is where the initial data enters the network.
2. Hidden layer(s): These layers process and transform the data from the input layer. There can be one or more hidden layers.
3. Output layer: This layer produces the final result or prediction.

Connections between nodes have associated weights, which determine the strength of the influence of one node on another. During the training process, the neural network learns by adjusting these weights to minimize the difference between its predicted output and the actual output.

Here's a simple example: Let's say you want to train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. You feed the network many images of handwritten digits along with their correct labels (0-9). The network processes these images through its layers, adjusting the weights of the connections between nodes. After training, when you input a new, unseen handwritten digit image, the network will use what it has learned to predict the correct digit.

In essence, neural networks learn from data by adjusting the strengths of the connections between artificial neurons, allowing them to recognize patterns, make predictions, or decide based on the input they receive.
