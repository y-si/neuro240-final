Generative and discriminative models are two different approaches to modeling and solving machine learning problems. Here are the key differences between them:

1. Approach:
   - Generative models learn the joint probability distribution P(X, Y) of the input features X and the corresponding labels Y. They model how the data is generated by capturing the underlying probability distribution.
   - Discriminative models learn the conditional probability distribution P(Y|X), which directly maps the input features X to the corresponding labels Y. They focus on learning the decision boundary between different classes.

2. Modeling:
   - Generative models try to understand and model the entire data generation process. They can generate new instances of data that resemble the training data by sampling from the learned probability distribution.
   - Discriminative models do not model the data generation process explicitly. Instead, they focus on learning the decision boundary or the mapping from input features to labels.

3. Training:
   - Generative models are trained to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. They estimate the parameters of the joint probability distribution P(X, Y) from the training data.
   - Discriminative models are trained to minimize the error in predicting the labels given the input features. They optimize the parameters to maximize the conditional probability P(Y|X) or minimize the classification error.

4. Applications:
   - Generative models are commonly used in tasks such as data generation, density estimation, anomaly detection, and handling missing data. Examples of generative models include Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
   - Discriminative models are widely used for classification and regression tasks. They are effective in learning the decision boundary and making predictions based on input features. Examples of discriminative models include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

5. Performance:
   - Discriminative models often achieve better performance in classification tasks compared to generative models, especially when the goal is to make accurate predictions.
   - Generative models can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data and can handle missing or incomplete data more naturally. They can also be used for data generation and sampling.

In summary, generative models focus on modeling
