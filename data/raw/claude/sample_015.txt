The main difference between compile-time and run-time errors lies in when they occur and how they are detected. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

1. Compile-time errors:
   - Compile-time errors, also known as syntax errors, occur during the compilation phase of a program.
   - They are detected by the compiler before the program is executed.
   - These errors prevent the program from being compiled successfully.
   - Compile-time errors are typically caused by mistakes in the source code, such as:
     - Syntax errors: Missing semicolons, parentheses, or braces, invalid keywords, etc.
     - Type errors: Assigning a value of the wrong type to a variable, passing arguments of the wrong type to a function, etc.
     - Undeclared variables or functions: Using a variable or function that hasn't been declared.
   - Compile-time errors are usually easier to detect and fix because the compiler provides specific error messages and line numbers indicating where the errors occurred.

2. Run-time errors:
   - Run-time errors, also known as exceptions, occur during the execution of a program.
   - They are detected while the program is running, after it has been successfully compiled.
   - Run-time errors cause the program to terminate abruptly or behave unexpectedly.
   - These errors are typically caused by issues that cannot be detected during compilation, such as:
     - Division by zero: Attempting to divide a number by zero.
     - Accessing an out-of-bounds array index: Trying to access an element outside the valid range of an array.
     - Null pointer dereference: Attempting to access or invoke a method on a null object reference.
     - Resource unavailability: Trying to open a file that doesn't exist or attempting to connect to a database that is not available.
   - Run-time errors are often more challenging to detect and debug because they depend on the specific input and execution conditions of the program.
   - Debugging techniques, such as using breakpoints, logging, and exception handling, are commonly employed to identify and resolve run-time errors.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the difference:

```python
# Compile-time error: Syntax error
if x >
