REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL are both architectural styles for designing APIs, but they have some key differences:

1. Data Fetching:
   - REST: In REST, each resource is represented by a unique URL, and you fetch data by making requests to these URLs. Each request usually returns a fixed structure of data.
   - GraphQL: In GraphQL, you send a query to a single URL endpoint, specifying the exact data you need. The server responds with only the requested data.

2. Flexibility:
   - REST: REST APIs have a fixed set of endpoints with a predefined structure of data returned from each endpoint.
   - GraphQL: GraphQL allows clients to define the structure of the data they need, making it more flexible. Clients can request specific fields and even traverse related resources in a single request.

3. Over/Under-Fetching:
   - REST: With REST, you may end up over-fetching (receiving more data than needed) or under-fetching (needing to make multiple requests to get all the required data).
   - GraphQL: GraphQL solves the over-fetching and under-fetching problems by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need, resulting in more efficient data retrieval.

4. Versioning:
   - REST: In REST, versioning is typically done by including a version number in the URL or using headers.
   - GraphQL: GraphQL uses a schema to define the available data and operations. Versioning can be handled by adding new fields or types without removing the old ones, allowing for backward compatibility.

5. Caching:
   - REST: REST APIs can leverage HTTP caching mechanisms, such as using caching headers like `Cache-Control` and `ETag`.
   - GraphQL: Caching in GraphQL is more complex due to its flexibility. Caching can be implemented at the field level or using a caching layer like Apollo Client.

6. Learning Curve:
   - REST: REST is relatively simple to understand and has been widely used for a long time, making it more familiar to developers.
   - GraphQL: GraphQL has a steeper learning curve, especially for server-side implementation. It requires understanding concepts like schemas, types, and resolvers.
