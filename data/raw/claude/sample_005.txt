Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm used for training artificial neural networks, particularly in supervised learning tasks. It is a method for efficiently calculating the gradients of the network's parameters (weights and biases) with respect to the loss function, enabling the network to learn and improve its performance.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of backpropagation:

1. Forward Pass:
   - The input data is fed into the neural network.
   - The activations of each neuron in the network are computed layer by layer, from the input layer to the output layer.
   - The output of the network is compared with the desired output (target) to calculate the loss or error.

2. Backward Pass:
   - The goal is to update the network's parameters to minimize the loss.
   - The gradients of the loss with respect to the network's parameters are calculated using the chain rule of calculus.
   - Starting from the output layer, the gradients are propagated backward through the network, layer by layer.
   - The gradients of each parameter are calculated by considering the gradients of the subsequent layer and the activations of the current layer.

3. Parameter Update:
   - The calculated gradients are used to update the network's parameters (weights and biases) using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent.
   - The parameters are adjusted in the direction that minimizes the loss, with a learning rate determining the step size of the updates.

4. Iteration:
   - Steps 1-3 are repeated for multiple iterations (epochs) over the training dataset until the network converges or a stopping criterion is met.
   - With each iteration, the network learns to better approximate the desired output by adjusting its parameters.

The key idea behind backpropagation is to efficiently calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter in the network. By propagating the gradients backward through the network, the algorithm allows for the simultaneous update of all parameters in a single pass, making it computationally efficient compared to other approaches.

Backpropagation has been a breakthrough in training deep neural networks and has contributed to the success of various applications, such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It enables the network to learn complex patterns and representations from the input data by adjust
