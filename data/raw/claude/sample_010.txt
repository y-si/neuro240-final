Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning architecture specifically designed to process and analyze grid-like data, such as images. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how CNNs process images:

1. Input Layer:
   - The input layer receives the raw pixel values of an image.
   - The image is typically represented as a 3D matrix with dimensions (height, width, channels), where channels correspond to color channels (e.g., RGB).

2. Convolutional Layers:
   - Convolutional layers are the core building blocks of CNNs.
   - Each convolutional layer consists of a set of learnable filters (also known as kernels) that slide over the input image.
   - The filters are small matrices (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) that contain learnable weights.
   - As the filters slide over the image, they perform element-wise multiplications and sum up the results to produce a feature map.
   - Multiple filters are applied in each convolutional layer, each detecting different features or patterns in the image.
   - The output of a convolutional layer is a set of feature maps that capture the presence of specific features at various locations in the image.

3. Activation Function:
   - After each convolutional layer, an activation function is applied element-wise to the feature maps.
   - Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which introduces non-linearity and helps the network learn complex patterns.

4. Pooling Layers:
   - Pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps spatially.
   - The most common pooling operation is max pooling, which selects the maximum value within a local neighborhood of the feature map.
   - Pooling helps to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, making the network more robust to small translations and reducing computational complexity.

5. Fully Connected Layers:
   - After several convolutional and pooling layers, the feature maps are flattened into a 1D vector.
   - The flattened vector is then fed into one or more fully connected (dense) layers.
   - Fully connected layers perform high-level reasoning and learn non
