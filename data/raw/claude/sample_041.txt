Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that efficiently sorts an array or list of elements. It follows these steps:

1. Choose a pivot element from the array. The pivot can be any element, but commonly the first, last, or middle element is chosen.

2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays based on the pivot:
   - The left sub-array contains elements smaller than or equal to the pivot.
   - The right sub-array contains elements greater than the pivot.

3. Recursively apply steps 1 and 2 to both sub-arrays until the sub-arrays have a length of 0 or 1, at which point they are considered sorted.

4. Combine the sorted sub-arrays and the pivot to obtain the final sorted array.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the partitioning process:

1. Set two pointers, one at the start of the array (left pointer) and one at the end (right pointer).

2. Move the left pointer rightward until an element greater than the pivot is found.

3. Move the right pointer leftward until an element smaller than or equal to the pivot is found.

4. If the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer, swap the elements at the left and right pointers. Then, move the left pointer one step right and the right pointer one step left.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the left pointer becomes greater than the right pointer. At this point, the array is partitioned, with the left sub-array containing elements smaller than or equal to the pivot and the right sub-array containing elements greater than the pivot.

Quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. However, in the worst case (when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element), it can degrade to O(n^2). To mitigate this, techniques like randomizing the pivot selection or using a median-of-three pivot selection strategy can be employed.
