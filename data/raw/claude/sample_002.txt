The main differences between supervised and unsupervised learning are:

1. Labeled data:
   - Supervised learning: The training data is labeled, meaning the input data has corresponding output labels or target values.
   - Unsupervised learning: The training data is unlabeled, and the algorithm learns patterns or structures from the input data without any predefined labels.

2. Goal:
   - Supervised learning: The goal is to learn a function that maps input data to the correct output labels, enabling the model to predict labels for new, unseen data.
   - Unsupervised learning: The goal is to discover inherent structures, patterns, or relationships within the input data without any specific output labels.

3. Types of tasks:
   - Supervised learning: It is used for tasks such as classification (predicting discrete class labels) and regression (predicting continuous values).
   - Unsupervised learning: It is used for tasks such as clustering (grouping similar data points), dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of features while preserving important information), and anomaly detection (identifying unusual or outlier data points).

4. Feedback:
   - Supervised learning: The model receives feedback in the form of correct output labels during training, allowing it to adjust its parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual labels.
   - Unsupervised learning: There is no explicit feedback provided to the model since there are no predefined output labels. The model learns based on the inherent patterns and structures in the data.

5. Examples of algorithms:
   - Supervised learning: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks.
   - Unsupervised learning: K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), Autoencoders.

6. Applications:
   - Supervised learning: Spam email classification, sentiment analysis, image classification, stock price prediction, medical diagnosis.
   - Unsupervised learning: Customer segmentation, image compression, topic modeling, recommender systems, anomaly detection in fraud or network intrusion.

In summary, supervised learning relies on labele
