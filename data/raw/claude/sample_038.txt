HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol that provides secure communication between a web browser and a website. It uses several mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data being transmitted:

1. Encryption:
   - HTTPS uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols to encrypt the data exchanged between the browser and the server.
   - The encryption prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting and reading the transmitted data.
   - It ensures confidentiality by converting the data into a coded format that can only be decrypted with the proper key.

2. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):
   - HTTPS relies on PKI, which uses digital certificates to verify the identity of the website.
   - The website's server presents a digital certificate to the browser, which contains the website's public key and is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   - The browser verifies the certificate's authenticity by checking the CA's signature and ensuring that the certificate is valid and not expired.

3. Secure Key Exchange:
   - HTTPS establishes a secure session between the browser and the server using a process called the SSL/TLS handshake.
   - During the handshake, the browser and server negotiate the encryption algorithms and exchange session keys securely.
   - The session keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data transmitted during the session.

4. Integrity Verification:
   - HTTPS uses message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data.
   - MACs or digital signatures are computed based on the data and a secret key, allowing the receiver to detect any tampering or modification of the data during transmission.

5. Secure Communication Indicators:
   - Web browsers typically display visual indicators, such as a padlock icon or a green address bar, to indicate that the connection is secure and the website's identity has been verified.
   - These indicators assure users that their communication with the website is protected and that they are interacting with the intended website.

By encrypting the data, verifying the website's identity, and ensuring data integrity, HTTPS provides a secure communication channel between the browser and the server. It protects sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal data, and financial
