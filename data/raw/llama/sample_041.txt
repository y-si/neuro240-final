**Quicksort Algorithm Overview**
=====================================

Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array of elements. It is known for its efficiency and is often used in many applications.

**How Quicksort Works**
------------------------

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the quicksort algorithm:

### 1. Choose a Pivot Element

The first step in the quicksort algorithm is to choose a pivot element from the array. The pivot element is used to partition the array into two subarrays.

### 2. Partition the Array

The array is partitioned into two subarrays: one containing elements less than the pivot element, and the other containing elements greater than the pivot element. This is done by iterating through the array and swapping elements that are in the wrong order.

### 3. Recursively Sort Subarrays

The subarrays are then recursively sorted using the same quicksort algorithm.

### 4. Combine the Results

The final step is to combine the results of the recursive calls to produce the sorted array.

**Example Walkthrough**
------------------------

Let's consider an example array: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3]`.

1. Choose a pivot element: `5`.
2. Partition the array:
	* Elements less than `5`: `[2, 1, 3]`.
	* Elements greater than `5`: `[9, 7]`.
3. Recursively sort subarrays:
	* Sort `[2, 1, 3]`: `[1, 2, 3]`.
	* Sort `[9, 7]`: `[7, 9]`.
4. Combine the results: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.

**Quicksort Algorithm Implementation**
--------------------------------------

Here's a simple implementation of the quicksort algorithm in Python:
```python
def quicksort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the quicksort algorithm.

    Args:
        arr (list): The array to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted array.
    """
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    pivot = arr[0]
    less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]
    greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]

    return quicksort(less) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater)

# Example usage:
arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3]
sorted_arr = quicksort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
**Time Complexity**
--------------------

The time complexity of the quicksort algorithm is O(n log n) on average, making it a very efficient sorting algorithm. However, in the worst-case scenario (e.g., when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element), the time complexity can be O(n^2).
