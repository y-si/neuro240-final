Batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network. It was introduced by Ioffe and Szegedy in 2015 as a way to improve the training speed and stability of deep neural networks.

**What problem does batch normalization solve?**

In deep neural networks, the input data for each layer is typically the output of the previous layer. However, the output of each layer can have a different scale and distribution, which can cause problems for the next layer. Specifically:

1. **Internal covariate shift**: The distribution of the input data changes as the network is trained, which can cause the next layer to have to adapt to a new distribution. This can slow down training and make it more difficult to converge.
2. **Vanishing or exploding gradients**: If the input data has a large range of values, the gradients of the loss function can become very small or very large, which can cause the network to converge slowly or not at all.

**How does batch normalization work?**

Batch normalization normalizes the input data for each layer by:

1. **Calculating the mean and standard deviation**: For each mini-batch of data, the mean and standard deviation of the input data are calculated.
2. **Normalizing the data**: The input data is then normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
3. **Scaling and shifting**: The normalized data is then scaled and shifted by learned parameters, which allows the network to learn the optimal scale and shift for each layer.

**Benefits of batch normalization**

Batch normalization has several benefits, including:

1. **Improved training speed**: By normalizing the input data, batch normalization can reduce the internal covariate shift and improve the training speed of the network.
2. **Improved stability**: Batch normalization can also improve the stability of the network by reducing the vanishing or exploding gradients.
3. **Improved generalization**: Batch normalization can also improve the generalization of the network by reducing overfitting.

**Common use cases**

Batch normalization is commonly used in deep neural networks, particularly in:

1. **Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**: Batch normalization is often used in CNNs to normalize the input data for each convolutional layer.
2. **Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**: Batch normalization can also be used in RNNs to normalize the input data for each recurrent layer.
3. **Generative models**: Batch normalization is often used in generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), to normalize the input data for each layer.

In summary, batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network, which can improve the training speed, stability, and generalization of the network.
