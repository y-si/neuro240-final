**Softmax Function in Neural Networks**
=====================================

The softmax function is a crucial component in neural networks, particularly in the output layer of classification models. It plays a key role in transforming the output of the network into a probability distribution over multiple classes.

**What is the Softmax Function?**
-------------------------------

The softmax function, also known as the normalized exponential function, is a mathematical function that takes a vector of real numbers as input and outputs a vector of values in the range (0, 1) that add up to 1. The function is defined as:

softmax(x) = exp(x) / Σ exp(x)

where x is the input vector, exp(x) is the exponential function applied element-wise to x, and Σ exp(x) is the sum of the exponential values.

**Role of Softmax in Neural Networks**
------------------------------------

In neural networks, the softmax function is typically used in the output layer of classification models, where the goal is to predict one of multiple classes. The softmax function serves several purposes:

1.  **Normalization**: The softmax function normalizes the output of the network, ensuring that the values are in the range (0, 1) and add up to 1. This is useful for interpreting the output as a probability distribution.
2.  **Probability Distribution**: The softmax function transforms the output of the network into a probability distribution over multiple classes. This allows the model to predict the probability of each class, rather than just the most likely class.
3.  **Differentiability**: The softmax function is differentiable, which is important for training neural networks using backpropagation.

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

Suppose we have a neural network that classifies images into one of three classes: cat, dog, and bird. The output of the network is a vector of three values, representing the scores for each class. We can apply the softmax function to this output to obtain a probability distribution over the three classes.

For example, if the output of the network is [2.5, 1.2, 0.8], the softmax function would output [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], indicating that the model predicts a 70% chance of the image being a cat, a 20% chance of it being a dog, and a 10% chance of it being a bird.

**Code Example**
----------------

Here is an example implementation of the softmax function in Python using NumPy:
```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(x):
    """
    Compute the softmax function for a given input vector.

    Parameters:
    x (numpy array): Input vector

    Returns:
    softmax_x (numpy array): Softmax output
    """
    exp_x = np.exp(x)
    softmax_x = exp_x / np.sum(exp_x)
    return softmax_x

# Example usage
x = np.array([2.5, 1.2, 0.8])
softmax_output = softmax(x)
print(softmax_output)
```
This code defines a `softmax` function that takes a NumPy array as input and returns the softmax output. The example usage demonstrates how to apply the softmax function to a sample input vector.
