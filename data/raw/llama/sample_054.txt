**Stack vs Queue: Understanding the Difference**
=====================================================

A stack and a queue are two fundamental data structures in computer science. While they share some similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their behavior and usage.

**Stack**
--------

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of a stack of plates: when you add a new plate, it goes on top of the existing ones, and when you remove a plate, it's the top one that comes off.

**Key Operations:**

*   **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
*   **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
*   **Peek**: Look at the top element without removing it.

**Queue**
--------

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Think of a line of people waiting for a concert: the person who arrives first is the first one to enter the venue.

**Key Operations:**

*   **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue.
*   **Dequeue**: Remove the front element from the queue.
*   **Peek**: Look at the front element without removing it.

**Comparison**
--------------

|  | Stack | Queue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Order** | Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) | First-In-First-Out (FIFO) |
| **Add** | Push (top) | Enqueue (end) |
| **Remove** | Pop (top) | Dequeue (front) |

**Example Use Cases**
--------------------

*   **Stack**: Evaluating postfix expressions, parsing syntax in compilers, implementing recursive algorithms iteratively.
*   **Queue**: Job scheduling in operating systems, print queues, network protocols like TCP/IP.

**Code Example (Python)**
-------------------------

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        else:
            raise IndexError("Stack is empty")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        else:
            raise IndexError("Stack is empty")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0


class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]
        else:
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0


# Example usage:
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2

queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1
```

In summary, a stack is a LIFO data structure, while a queue is a FIFO data structure. Understanding the differences between these two data structures is crucial for solving problems in computer science and software development.
