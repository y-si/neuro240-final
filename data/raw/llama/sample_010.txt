Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited for image processing tasks. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how they process images:

**Step 1: Image Input**
The image is fed into the CNN as a 3D array of pixel values, where each pixel is represented by three color channels (red, green, and blue). The image is typically resized to a fixed size to ensure that all images have the same dimensions.

**Step 2: Convolutional Layers**
The image is then passed through multiple convolutional layers, which are the core building blocks of a CNN. Each convolutional layer consists of:

* **Filters (Kernels)**: Small, learnable matrices that slide over the image, scanning for patterns. These filters are typically 3x3 or 5x5 pixels in size.
* **Convolution Operation**: The filter is applied to each region of the image, computing the dot product between the filter and the image pixels. This produces a feature map, which represents the presence of a particular pattern in the image.
* **Activation Function**: The feature map is then passed through an activation function, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which introduces non-linearity to the model.

**Step 3: Feature Extraction**
The convolutional layers extract features from the image, such as edges, lines, and textures. These features are represented as feature maps, which are stacked together to form a feature cube.

**Step 4: Pooling Layers**
To reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature cube and retain the most important information, pooling layers are applied. There are two types of pooling:

* **Max Pooling**: Selects the maximum value from each region of the feature map.
* **Average Pooling**: Computes the average value from each region of the feature map.

**Step 5: Flattening**
The feature cube is then flattened into a 1D array, which is fed into fully connected layers.

**Step 6: Fully Connected Layers**
The flattened array is passed through multiple fully connected layers, which are used for classification or regression tasks. These layers consist of:

* **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with learnable weights and biases.
* **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity to the model.

**Step 7: Output**
The final output of the CNN is a probability distribution over the possible classes or a continuous value for regression tasks.

**Key Concepts**

* **Local Connectivity**: CNNs only connect neurons that are spatially close, which reduces the number of parameters and improves performance.
* **Shared Weights**: The same filter is applied to all regions of the image, which reduces the number of parameters and improves performance.
* **Translation Equivariance**: CNNs are translation equivariant, meaning that the output is the same regardless of the position of the input.

Overall, CNNs process images by extracting features through convolutional and pooling layers, and then using fully connected layers to classify or regress the output.
